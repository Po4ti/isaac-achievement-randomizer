TODO:

- text on achievement to show what was unlocked

- unlock logic:
  - revival items unlock once all character related achievements are completed
    - Lazarus Rags + Judas' Shadow + Ankh + Missing Poster
  - mutual character logic for unlocks (e.g. if the forgotten unlocks Magdalene, make sure it's not magdalene who unlocks forgotten)
  - battery pack behind lil battery
  - Bogo Bombs behind double bomb

- write runtime check for achievements matching

- add timer for speedruns

- finish dead sea scrolls
  - Achievement List tooltip should display X / X
