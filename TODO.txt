TODO:
- add timer for speedruns

- Achievement List tooltip should display X / X

- unlock logic:
  - revival items unlock once all character related achievements are completed
    - Lazarus Rags + Judas' Shadow + Ankh + Missing Poster
  - mutual character logic for unlocks (e.g. if the forgotten unlocks Magdalene, make sure it's not magdalene who unlocks forgotten)
