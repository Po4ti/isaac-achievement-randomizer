TODO:

- assign achievements
- write runtime check for achievements matching

- text on achievement to show what was unlocked

- death tracker should detect non-finished runs where the player did not die, verify this works

- unlock logic:
  - revival items unlock once all character related achievements are completed
    - Ankh (#161) + Judas' Shadow (#311) + Lazarus Rags (#332) + Mysterious Paper (#21) + Missing Poster (#23)
  - mutual character logic for unlocks (e.g. if the forgotten unlocks Magdalene, make sure it's not magdalene who unlocks forgotten)
  - battery pack behind lil battery
  - Bogo Bombs behind double bomb

- finish dead sea scrolls
  - Achievement List tooltip should display X / X
