# Achievement Randomizer

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

This page explains how the Achievement Randomizer mod works.

<br>

## Design

This mod **does not** simply randomize all of the vanilla achievements. This is for several reasons:

1. [Other mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838967057) have already done that.
1. Some of the vanilla achievements do not make sense in the context of a player trying to "beat the game" in the least amount of death possible, like `The Scissors - Die 100 times` or `Mr. Resetter! - Reset 7 times in a row`. (This would make the minimum amount of deaths always be 100.)
1. Some achievements do not make sense in the context of a player trying to "beat the game" in the fastest time possible, like `Dedication - Participate in 31 Daily Challenges`. (This would make the minimum amount of time always be 31 days.)
1. Some achievements are arbitrary conditions and are not very fun to play, like `They will charge you up... for a small fee - Donate to Battery Bums until they pay out with an item 5 times`. (If you are not lucky enough to get this achievement during your streak, the most consistent strategy is to reset as Tainted Keeper in Greed Mode until you see a Battery Bum in the shop. This is "busywork" and is not skill-based in any way.)

Thus, this mod locks almost every collectible and trinket behind custom achievements that actually represent meaningful accomplishments inside of the game.

## Achievement List

### Character-Based Achievements

Each character will unlock something upon defeating the following bosses/objectives:

- Mom
- It Lives
- Isaac
- Blue Baby
- Satan
- The Lamb
- Mega Satan
- Boss Rush
- Hush
- Ultra Greed
- Delirium
- Mother
- The Beast

There are 13 objectives in total. Each objective must be accomplished in hard mode. Thus, since there are 34 main characters, there are 34 x 13 = 442 character-based achievements.

### Challenge-Based Achievements

There is one achievement for each challenge. Thus, there are 46 challenge-based achievements.

### Other Achievements

- Digging the grave in the Dark Room that normally unlocks The Forgotten.

## Progression

### Characters

The first character unlocked will be Isaac. All other characters start off locked.

### Challenges

### Paths

- TODO
- Defeating Mom for the first time ends the game, similar to how the vanilla game works.
