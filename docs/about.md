# Achievement Randomizer

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

This page explains how the Achievement Randomizer mod works.

<br>

## Design Principles

This mod **does not** simply randomize all of the vanilla achievements. This is for several reasons:

1. [Other mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838967057) have already done that.
1. Some of the vanilla achievements do not make sense in the context of a player trying to "beat the game" in the least amount of death possible, like `The Scissors - Die 100 times` or `Mr. Resetter! - Reset 7 times in a row`. (This would make the minimum amount of deaths always be 100.)
1. Some vanilla achievements do not make sense in the context of a player trying to "beat the game" in the fastest time possible, like `Dedication - Participate in 31 Daily Challenges`. (This would make the minimum amount of time always be 31 days.)
1. Some vanilla achievements are arbitrary conditions and are not very fun to play, like `They will charge you up... for a small fee - Donate to Battery Bums until they pay out with an item 5 times`. (If you are not lucky enough to get this achievement during your streak, the most consistent strategy is to reset as Tainted Keeper in Greed Mode until you see a Battery Bum in the shop. This is "busywork" and is not skill-based in any way.)
1. Many things are not gated behind vanilla achievements and it would be fun if they were (e.g. soul hearts, locked chests).

Thus, this mod locks almost everything behind custom achievements that actually represent meaningful accomplishments inside of the game.

## Achievement List

Note that all achievements must be completed on hard mode. (Playing this mod on normal mode or on non-Greedier Greed Mode will automatically restart the run with the correct difficultly.)

### Character-Based Achievements

Each character will unlock something upon defeating the following bosses/objectives:

1. Mom
2. It Lives
3. Isaac
4. Blue Baby
5. Satan
6. The Lamb
7. Mega Satan
8. Boss Rush
9. Hush
10. Ultra Greed
11. Delirium
12. Mom's Heart (in Mausoleum/Gehenna)
13. Mother
14. Dogma
15. The Beast

Additionally, each character other than The Lost and Tainted Lost will unlock something upon clearing the following floors without taking damage:

1. Basement 1 / Cellar 1 / Burning Basement 1
2. Basement 2 / Cellar 2 / Burning Basement 2
3. Caves 1 / Catacombs 1 / Flooded Caves 1
4. Caves 2 / Catacombs 2 / Flooded Caves 2
5. Depths 1 / Necropolis 1 / Dank Depths 1
6. Depths 2 / Necropolis 2 / Dank Depths 2
7. Womb 1 / Utero 1 / Scarred Womb 1
8. Womb 2 / Utero 2 / Scarred Womb 2
9. Cathedral / Sheol
10. The Chest / Dark Room
11. Downpour 1 / Dross 1
12. Downpour 2 / Dross 2
13. Mines 1 / Ashpit 1
14. Mines 2 / Ashpit 2
15. Mausoleum 1 / Gehenna 1
16. Mausoleum 2 / Gehenna 2
17. Corpse 1
18. Corpse 2

- There are 34 main characters.
- There are 15 boss objectives and 18 floor objectives, which makes 33 in total.
- Thus, since the Lost & Tainted Lost do not have floor achievements, there are 34 x 33 - 18 x 2 = 1086 character-based achievements.

### Challenge-Based Achievements

There is one achievement for each challenge. Thus, there are 45 challenge-based achievements.

### Other Achievements

The following achievements from the original game are retained:

- Digging the grave in the Dark Room that normally unlocks The Forgotten.
